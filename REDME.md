Candidates would create an online profile on the recruitment platform, which would include their education, work experience, skills, and other relevant information.
Companies looking to hire new employees would post job openings on the platform, specifying the qualifications and skills they're looking for in candidates.
The platform would use algorithms to match candidates with relevant job openings, based on the information in their profile and the requirements listed by the company.
Once a candidate is matched with a job opening, they would be notified and given the option to apply for the position.
If the candidate decides to apply, they would be directed to a course platform where they would take a certification test related to the job opening. The test would be designed to assess their knowledge and skills related to the job requirements.
If the candidate passes the certification test, their profile would be automatically sent to the company for further consideration.
The company would review the candidate's profile and test results, and if they're interested, they would invite the candidate for an interview.
If the interview goes well, the company could make a job offer to the candidate, and the recruitment process would be complete.
Overall, this automated recruitment process would help streamline the hiring process for companies, while also giving candidates a fair and objective way to demonstrate their qualifications for a particular job opening.
